    "text": "Project Overview\nDuring a two month internship with BC Children‚Äôs Hosptial‚Äôs Digital Lab, my team and I created an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot for medical queries. It provides trustworthy information to patients and caregivers via a dataset of curated healthcare resources.\n\n\nImpact\n\nGeneral: Enabled reliable document retrieval across large, heterogeneous data sources, adaptable to multiple industries (healthcare, finance, legal, etc.).\nDomain-specific: Helped caregivers and patients quickly access trusted resources, reducing time spent searching and improving information accessibility.\nOrganizational: Delivered a baseline retrieval pipeline that can be reused by the hospital‚Äôs tech team for other document collections, lowering future development costs.\n\n\n\nKey Features\n\nDocument Retrieval: Semantic search with FAISS + optional ColBERT reranking for improved relevance\nData Preprocessing: Parsing, cleaning and chunking of heterogenous data sources (PDFs, websites, etc.)\nLLM Integration: LLM-powered answer generation with LangChain for structured output and prompt engineering to minimize hallucination\nEvaluation Toolkit: Multi-metric assessment using both retrieval metrics (precision, recall, F1) and generation quality metrics (LLM judge, semantic similarity scores)\n\nObject Oriented Design: Modular and scalable system to facilitate integration of new data sources and models.\nFrontend Application: Intuitive chatbot interface for physicians and patients\nDocumentation: Complete documentation for maintaining and modifying the system, ensuring smooth handoff to the hospital‚Äôs development team\n\n\n\nTech Stack\n\nLanguages: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS\nML/AI: LangChain, LLM API integration (OpenAI, Google Gen AI, Hugging Face)\nVector Database: FAISS, ColBERT reranking\nWeb Framework: Flask\nEvaluation: Prometheus-Eval, AlignScore, BERT Score, BLEU Score, etc.\nTools: Jupyter notebooks, Git"

    "text": "Project Details\n\nProblem Statement\nPatients and families often struggle to find reliable, accessible medical information online. While there are many healthcare resources available, navigating them effectively requires significant time and effort. There was a need for a system that could understand medical questions and provide accurate, trustworthy answers.\n\n\nApproach & Solution\nRead more about our approach on Medium\n\n\nResults\nBy the end of our internship, we had:\n- Created a baseline retrieval system for future healthcare AI applications at BC Children‚Äôs Hospital\n- Implemented comprehensive evaluation pipeline for both retrieval and generation quality\n- Created a user-friendly chatbot interface that provides answers with source links\n\n\nKey Challenges\nThere were several challenges we faced:\n- Data Quality & Variety: Handling messy, heterogeneous data from various healthcare sources with different formats and structures\n- LLM Hallucination: Implementing prompt engineering strategies to minimize hallucination, though complete elimination proved challenging\n- Evaluation Framework: Designing an evaluation framework for LLM outputs without extensive manual annotation\n\n\n‚Üê Back to Portfolio"
