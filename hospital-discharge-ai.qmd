During a two month internship with BC Children's Hosptial, my team and I created an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot for medical queries. It provides trustworthy information to patients and caregivers via a dataset of curated healthcare resources.

## Project Details

### Problem Statement
Patients and families often struggle to find reliable, accessible medical information online. While there are many healthcare resources available, navigating them effectively requires significant time and effort. There was a need for a system that could understand medical questions and provide accurate, trustworthy answers.

### Approach & Solution
We opted to develop a custom RAG system that combines:  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and chunking of public healthcare resources and websites  
- **Semantic Search**: FAISS vector database with optional ColBERT reranking for improved relevance  
- **Response Generation**: LLM-powered answer generation using LangChain for structured output  
- **Evaluation Framework**: Multi-metric assessment using both retrieval metrics (precision, recall, F1) and generation quality metrics (LLM judges, semantic similarity scores)
- **Object Oriented Design**: Designed a modular and scalable system, allowing for easy integration of new data sources and models.

### Results & Impact
By the end of our internship, we had:  
- Created a baseline retrieval system for future healthcare AI applications at BC Children's Hospital    
- Implemented comprehensive evaluation pipeline for both retrieval and generation quality  
- Created a user-friendly chatbot interface that provides answers with source links  

### Key Challenges
There were several challenges we faced:  
- **Data Quality & Variety**: Handling messy, heterogeneous data from various healthcare sources with different formats and structures  
- **LLM Hallucination**: Implementing prompt engineering strategies to minimize hallucination, though complete elimination proved challenging  
- **Evaluation Framework**: Designing an evaluation framework for LLM outputs without extensive manual annotation
