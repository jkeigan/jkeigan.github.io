## Project Overview

During a two month internship with BC Children's Hosptial's Digital Lab, my team and I created an **end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** for medical queries. It provides trustworthy information to patients and caregivers via a dataset of curated healthcare resources.

### **Key Features**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Parsing, cleaning and chunking of heterogenous data sources (PDFs, websites, etc.)
- **Semantic Search**: FAISS vector database with optional ColBERT reranking for improved relevance  
- **LLM Integration**: LLM-powered answer generation with LangChain for structured output and prompt engineering to minimize hallucination
- **Evaluation Toolkit**: Multi-metric assessment using both retrieval metrics (precision, recall, F1) and generation quality metrics (LLM judges, semantic similarity scores)  
- **Object Oriented Design**: Modular and scalable system to facilitate integration of new data sources and models.
- **Frontend Application**: Intuitive chatbot interface for physicians and patients
- **Documentation**: Complete documentation for maintaining and modifying the system, ensuring smooth handoff to the hospital's development team

## Project Details

### Problem Statement
Patients and families often struggle to find reliable, accessible medical information online. While there are many healthcare resources available, navigating them effectively requires significant time and effort. There was a need for a system that could understand medical questions and provide accurate, trustworthy answers.

### Results & Impact
By the end of our internship, we had:  
- Created a baseline retrieval system for future healthcare AI applications at BC Children's Hospital    
- Implemented comprehensive evaluation pipeline for both retrieval and generation quality  
- Created a user-friendly chatbot interface that provides answers with source links  

### Key Challenges
There were several challenges we faced:  
- **Data Quality & Variety**: Handling messy, heterogeneous data from various healthcare sources with different formats and structures  
- **LLM Hallucination**: Implementing prompt engineering strategies to minimize hallucination, though complete elimination proved challenging  
- **Evaluation Framework**: Designing an evaluation framework for LLM outputs without extensive manual annotation
